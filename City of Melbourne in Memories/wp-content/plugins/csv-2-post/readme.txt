= Why CSV 2 POST? = 

CSV 2 POST offers longer term management of the data used to generate posts, than most plugins. 
If you need to do a quick job, build a quick WP and still be prepared for unexpected changes
in your project/site. Then CSV 2 POST is the plugin you need. The interface has a sandbox approach
allowing users to submit any form at anytime. That means when you suddenly realize your posts need
to change or your original source of data has changed. You can simply use any of the tools available
to get the job done with minimum fuss. CSV 2 POST is intended to be permanently installed however
you can use it for quick projects and remove the plugin also. Please see the plugins portal and follow
the tutorials provided to get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= As a WebTechGlobal subscriber can I get higher priority support for this plugin? =
Yes - subscribers are put ahead of my Free Workflow and will not only result in a quicker response for support
but requests for new features are marked with higher priority.

= Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me? =
Yes - you can pay to improve the plugin to suit your needs. However many improvements will be done free.
Please post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable
within my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks
priority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.

= Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds? =
Download .csv files from Commission Junction then upload them or paste a URL directly to a .csv file on any domain to import it that way.
Commission Junction and all other affiliate networks are supported. 

= Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create? =
There are no limits others than what your server will allow you to do in a single request.

= Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO? = 
Yes CSV 2 POST allows the creation of post meta (custom fields) which are used by most SEO solutions. More support can be added on
request for free. The plugin also offers text-spinning without limits and there is more planned on that.

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the WordPress core.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the CSV 2 POST plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if you need any recent changes. There is nothing wrong with skipping versions if changes do not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.
