Further works were carried out in the 1960s following the introduction of the standard gauge spacing for rails. The next redevelopment spanned 2002-2006 and included the addition of retail outlets. Spencer Street Station was then renamed Southern Cross Station.  In 2007 the station was judged the most outstanding building outside the European Union by the Royal Institute of British Architects' and the undulating roof is of particular interest.`...</div>
