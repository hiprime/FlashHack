The building was designed by Victorian Railways Department Engineering Office and was to be built of bluestone but was constructed of brickwork with stucco due to high costs. Until 1985 the building was home to the Victorian Railways. Originally comprising a basement and three floors, a fourth floor was added in 1912 and then an attic in 1922. The size of the building reflects VictoriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expanding railway network in the 1880s. Later developed as the Grand Hotel.]]></titleanddateinscribedbyphotographeronversophotographer27sstamponversoshowseightstoreybrickbuilding>

It boasted over 2 million new and second hand books and was famous around the world. The store offered a jovial atmosphere for its customers with a pianist, a fernery and menagerie, along with toys and a confectionery department. Cole provided comfortable chairs for customers and encouraged them to read without buying. Cole also published many editions of his own picture book, Cole's Funny Picture Book, which sold in the hundreds of thousands.
